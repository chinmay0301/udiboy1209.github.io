Hello! This is Meet Udeshi, a (soon-to-be) second year undergraduate student at IIT Bombay.<br>
Coding, tinkering with electronics/robotics, and watching movies/TV shows are some of my favourite hobbies. <br>
I also like painting, watching movies and TV series.
<br><br>
I've done a lot of interesting coding stuff (cool Android apps, games and much more :P) - Check out the <a href="?menu=projects">Projects</a> section.  
<br><br>
I am currently a convener for <a href="https://facebook.com/electronicsiitb">The Electronics Club - IIT Bombay</a>
