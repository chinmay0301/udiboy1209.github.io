Hello! This is Meet Udeshi, a first year undergraduate student at IIT Bombay.<br>
Coding, tinkering with electronics/robotics, and watching movies/TV shows are some of my favourite hobbies. <br>
I also like painting, reading suspense novels and solving physics problems if I get the time.
<br><br>
I've done a lot of interesting coding stuff (cool Android games and the like :P) - Check out the <a href="#projects" onclick="tabScroll('projects')">Projects</a> section.  
<br><br>
I've just started working on robotics projects (XLR8 car, RC plane, etc.)
